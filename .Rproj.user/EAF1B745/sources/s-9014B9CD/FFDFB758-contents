Questions for Nedghie

ACTIVE

- Why would ENERC_KCAL differ between Nedghie's data and CDC data provided by NBDPS?
    - Same with VITD
- Even using Nedghie's data, case numbers off by 2 (Nedghie 30,349; mine 30,351)

    nedghie_data %>%
      filter(
        missmorethan1 == 0 &
        missingkcal == 0 &
        kcal_ex == 0
      ) %>%
      count(case)

         case     n
         0    11168
         1    30351 (why the extra 2? am I missing a filtering step?)

SOLVED

- Where is uv_merged$VITD from? (Not the same as uv_merged$VitDb or bd_uv_clean$VITD)
    # SOLVED
    # CDC has three variables called VITD; Kathy provided me the one Nedghie et al are using
- Not getting the same tertiles from uv_merged$VITD as Nedghie did in her file... there's a note: "Distribution for tertiles is obtained after removing missing/implausible FFQ values. " Is there additional code I should know about to correct the tertiles I'm getting?
    # SOLVED
    # SAS and R calculate quantiles differently by default - use `type=2` to compute like SAS
